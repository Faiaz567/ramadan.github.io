                The word Ramadan derives from the Arabic root R-M-Ḍ (ر-م-ض‎) "scorching heat". Ramadan is one of the names of God in Islam, <br>and as such it is reported in many hadiths that it is prohibited to <br> say only "Ramadan" in reference to the calendar month and that <br> it is necessary to say "month of Ramadan.Ramadan falls on the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, is the most religiously significant time of year for Muslims throughout the world.This is <br> a month of fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims.  During this time,  Muslims refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset, and strive to avoid thoughts and behavior which are considered to be impure under the tenets of Islam. <br><br> Muslims believe that the spiritual rewards for this good behavior are increased during Ramadan.
                This fast is broken each day with a meal shared amongst family and friends, and the end of Ramadan culminates in a three-day festival, known as Eid al-Fitr.
                The origins of Ramadan lie in the life of Muhammad (SAW), the founding prophet of Islam, and in the story of his encounter with the divine.

                When Prophet Muhammad(SAW) was forty, he began to spend time in solitude, thinking on questions which troubled him. To do this, he took on the habit of retreating to a cave within a mountain called al-Ḥirā for a month at a time.One year, around 610 CE, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) went up to al-Ḥirā on a day like any other, but he was soon visited by the archangel Gabriel, who took hold of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and commanded terrified man to “read.” Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was so afraid that he refused twice before actually asking what it was he was supposed to read.
                <br> <br>Gabriel replied with <br>
                "Proclaim! in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who <br>
                Created man, out of a clot of congealed blood: <br>
                Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,– <br>
                Who taught by the pen– <br>
                Taught man that which he knew not.""

                Gabriel then proclaimed that “Thou art the messenger of God and I am Gabriel,” and Prophet Muhammad(SAW) fled the cave, thinking that he had been accosted by an evil spirit. He ran down the mountainside, and as he did, the angel, Gabriel, appeared in its true form in the sky above him, filling the entire sky, which had become green, which, incidentally, is where Islam gains its official color.
                <br> <br>When Prophet Muhammad (SAW) returned home, he told his family of what had happened, and when he sought the wisdom of a particularly devout Christian relative, he was told that he had been chosen as a prophet of God.
                <br> <br>Shortly after, Prophet Muhammad(SAW) began to receive further revelations from Gabriel, as well as from the realizations of his own heart. According to hadith—the stories about Muhammad’s life—all holy scriptures were sent down during Ramadan, making these 30 days the holiest in this religion. <br> <br>
                The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (SAW) over a period of 23 years, and the verses instructing Muslims to fast the entire month of Ramadan came in the latter half of that period. During the first 12 years in Mecca, the Muslim minority faced torture, tyranny and persecution from the Qurayshi ruling pagan tribe, with many losing their lives. The surviving Muslims migrated to the city of Medina in 622 AD, over 300km away. Two years later, the verses about fasting in Ramadan were revealed, with Prophet Muhammad establishing the holy month’s practices in the sanctuary of their new home.

                The requirement to fast during Ramadan, is the fourth of the Five Pillars of Islam. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim calendar, and special because it was the month the Prophet first began to receive revelations of the Qur'an from Allah.

Dr Sabah al-Baqir from the Medical Faculty of University of King Saud reveals that fasting will generate a specific hormone which may relieve tension and make a person feel better physically and mentally.

                  [Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] – then an equal number of days [are to be made up].

            <p>
              The common practice is to fast from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is called iftar.
              Muslims devote more time to prayer and acts of charity, striving to improve their self-discipline, motivated by hadith: "When Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in chains."

              Fasting
              </h3>
              <p>
                Ramadan is a time of spiritual reflection, self-improvement, and heightened devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (sawm) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking during this time, Muslims abstain from sexual relations[3] and sinful speech and behaviour during Ramadan fasting or month. The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, its purpose being to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Muslims believe that Ramadan teaches them to practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate, thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (zakat).
                Muslims also believe that for the poor people who don't have enough food they should fast so that the poor can get food to eat. This would also make them realize how poor feel when they remain hungry. The aim of fasting now seems to be being compassionate towards the poor people.
                Exemptions to fasting include travel, menstruation, severe illness, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. However, many Muslims with medical conditionsinsist on fasting to satisfy their spiritual needs, although it is not recommended by hadith. Those unable to fast are obligated make up the missed days later.

              Suhoor
              </h3>
              <p>
                Sahūr or sahoor (حور‎, romanized: saḥūr, lit. 'of the dawn', 'pre-dawn meal') is the meal consumed early in the morning by Muslims before fasting (sawm), before dawn during or outside the Islamic month of Ramadan. The meal is eaten before fajr prayer. Suhur is matched to iftar as the evening meal, during Ramadan, replacing the traditional three meals a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), although in some places dinner is also consumed after iftar later during the night.
                Being the last meal eaten by Muslims before fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, sahur is regarded by Islamic traditions as a benefit of the blessings in that it allows the person fasting to avoid the crankiness or the weakness caused by the fast. According to a hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari, Anas ibn Malik narrated, "The Prophet said, 'take suhoor as there is a blessing in it.'

              Ifter

              <p>
                Iftar (إفطار‎, romanized: ʾifṭār, lit. 'break of a fast'), also known as fatoor (from فطور fuṭūr 'breakfast'), is the evening meal with which Muslims end their daily Ramadan fast at sunset.They break their fast at the time of the call to prayer for the evening prayer. This is their second meal of the day; the daily fast during Ramadan begins immediately after the pre-dawn meal of suhur and continues during the daylight hours, ending with sunset with the evening meal of iftar.
                At sunset, families break the fast with the iftar, traditionally opening the meal by eating dates to commemorate Prophet Muhammad (SAW) practice of breaking the fast with three dates. They then adjourn for Maghrib, the fourth of the five required daily prayers, after which the main meal is served.
                Performing Iftar is an act that brings blessings for Muslims. It is said that Allah (SWT) will open the gates of forgiveness for those who help fast observers in acquiring adequate Iftar to break their fast at this time. It is Sunnah to break the fast with dates. Iftar is the time to make supplications that you would not want to miss out.
                <br> Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: <br> “When the fasting person breaks his fast, his supplication is not turned back.” (Ibn Majah)

              Charity
              </h3>
              <p>
                Zakat (Arabic: زكاة‎ zakāh [zaˈkaːh], "that which purifies",also Zakat al-mal [zaˈkaːt alˈmaːl] زكاة المال, "zakat on wealth",or Zakah) is a form of alms-giving treated in Islam as a religious obligation or tax,[4][5] which, by Quranic ranking, is next after prayer (salat) in importance.
                As one of the Five Pillars of Islam, zakat is a religious duty for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth. It is a mandatory charitable contribution, often considered to be a tax. The payment and disputes on zakat have played a major role in the history of Islam, notably during the Ridda wars.
                Zakat is based on the value of all of one's possessions. It is customarily 2.5% (or 1/40) of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount known as nisab, but Islamic scholars differ on how much nisab is and other aspects of zakat.[15] According to Islamic doctrine, the collected amount should be paid to the poor and the needy, Zakat collectors, those recently converted to Islam, those to be freed from slavery, those in debt, in the cause of Allah and to benefit the stranded traveller.

              Tarawih
              </h3>
              <p>
                Tarawih (Arabic: تراويح‎, literally "rest and relaxation", a term introduced later and actually called Qiyam al-Layl and Tahajjud in Qur'an and Sahih Hadith) refers to additional ritual prayers performed by Muslims at night after the Isha prayer during the holy month of Ramadan. It may involve reading one Juz' (Arabic: جُزْء, i.e a section of the Quran 1/30 its length, which generally takes somewhere between 20-60 minutes), and usually is 8 or 10 raka'at, lasting well over an hour in total. According to some scholar, there are 20 rakats."In the time of Umar, the people used to offer 20 raka'āt". But it is clearly mentioned in the Muwatta' before the said narration that when Umar assigned duty to Ubay ibn Ka'b and Tamim al-Dari to lead the Tarawih, he ordered them to offer 11 rakats (8 of tarawih and 3 of witr).
                Unlike the five daily salat ritual prayers which are fard (obligatory) under Islamic law, tarawih is from the sunnah (recommended or lit. words and acts of the prophet Muhammad SAW).
                <br>
                Sunni Muslims believe it is customary to attempt a takmil ("complete recitation" of the Quran) as one of the religious observances of Ramadan, by reciting at least one juz' per night in tarawih.
                Tarawih prayers are considered optional (sunnah), not obligatory

              <h3>
              Recitation of the Quran
              </h3>
              <p>
                Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran, which comprises thirty juz' (sections), over the thirty days of Ramadan. Some Muslims incorporate a recitation of one juz' into each of the thirty tarawih sessions observed during the month.
                Allah blesses the one who recites the Quran, infact there is a reward for every letter that is uttered out of the mouth of the believer of Islam and the Quran. The Holy Prophet  (PBUH) said, about the recitation of the Quran,  “Whoever draws near to Allah during it (Ramadan) with a single characteristic from the characteristics of (voluntary) goodness, he is like whoever performs an obligatory act in other times. And whoever performs an obligatory act during it, he is like whoever performed seventy obligatory acts in other times.” (Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, no. 1887)
